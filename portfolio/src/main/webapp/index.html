      <p>
          I am a student in the University of Pennsylvania's Management and Technology Class of 2023, studying Computer Science and Economics.
          Currently, I am a Google STEP 2020 Intern, and I was formerly a Microsoft AI Platform Intern (Jun - Aug 2019).
          I love reading and playing tennis, though recently, I've taken up running and calisthenics due to the quarantine.
